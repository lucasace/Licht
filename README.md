# Licht

## Description 

Some people think that the sense of sight is one of the major requirements in the world of programming. It might be a requirement but we consider it be optional and not a neccessity.
Nevertheless, It is a bit more difficult for the visually impaired to learn to code than the unimpaired. We by this project attempt to make it a bit more simpler for the visually-impaired to enjoy the world of code. All that is required is a browser and a url and rest all is communicated through the sense of sound and implemented by the sense of touch.

We bring a webpage containing simple programming tutorials in python. Each tutorial is communicated through voice and all that is required to run is pressing of some keys on the keyboard
