 The if statement is used to control 

 the program flow in a Python program. 


 This makes it possible to decide at runtime whether 


 certain program parts should be executed or not.


 The simplest form of an if statement 


 in a Python program looks like this:

 if 

 condition colon
    
 tabspace  


 statement


 The statement is only executed 

 if the condition 

 is True.

 y is greater than x
